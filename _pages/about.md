I am a Ph.D. student studying computer architecture in [Berkeley Architecture Reseach](https://bar.eecs.berkeley.edu/), as part of the [ADEPT Lab](https://adept.eecs.berkeley.edu/), advised by [Krste AsanoviÄ‡](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~krste/).

A list of open-source projects I have developed:

 * [The Berkeley Out-of-Order Machine](https://boom-core.org/), a high-performance super-scalar out-of-order RISC-V processor
 * [Chipyard](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chipyard), a RISC-V SoC design framework
 * [Constellation](https://constellation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a Chisel network-on-chip generator
 * [ReRoCC](https://github.com/ucb-bar/rerocc), a accelerator disaggregation interface and programming model
 * [Shuttle](https://constellation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a area-efficient dual-issue RISC-V processor
 * [Saturn](https://saturn-vectors.org/), a compliant compact RISC-V vector unit

I also contribute to
 * [RocketChip](https://github.com/chipsalliance/rocket-chip), a library of Chisel generators for RISC-V SoCs
 * [Spike](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-isa-sim), a RISC-V functional ISA simulator
 * [Gemmini](https://github.com/ucb-bar/gemmini), a systolic-array machine-learning accelerator
