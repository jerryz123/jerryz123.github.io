I am a Ph.D. student studying computer architecture in [Berkeley Architecture Reseach](https://bar.eecs.berkeley.edu/), as part of the [ADEPT Lab](https://adept.eecs.berkeley.edu/), advised by [Krste AsanoviÄ‡](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~krste/).

I primarily work on the [Berkeley Out-of-Order Machine](https://boom-core.org/), an open-source, RISC-V implementation of a modern high-performance general-purpose processor. I am also a major contributor to the [Chipyard](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chipyard) hardware design framework.
